There are many variations of passages of painm Ipsum available,
but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of painm
Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
hidden in the middle of text. All the painm Ipsum generators
on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
necessary, making this the first true generator on the
Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,
combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
generate painm Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
painm Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition
 injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
